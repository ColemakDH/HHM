        <h2>About PEP</h2> 
        <p>Mission: PEP strives to enhance the development of our students by providing travel training, independent life skills, community internships, workplace
          readiness and self-determination skills.
        
        <br><br>Vision:  To offer students a successful transition through a continuum of community resources, technology utilization,
          instructional strategies and diverse course offerings.  School and family partner together with community service providers to establish future career planning. 
        
        <br><br>PEP is a community based program for supported work experience, supported travel training, and independent living training.
        One of the many goals of PEP is to empower our young adults with self-advocacy through self-determination. Students learn independent living
        and work readiness skills within community settings, and all skills are tailored to meet individual student needs.  PEP partners with local businesses
        to help teach work and social skills within the business setting.
        
        <br><br>These internships experiences provide an opportunity for students to demonstrate their talents. Two days a week, when students are at the
        Career Center for a full day, teachers engage students in direct instruction in the domains of personal finance, technology skills, resume writing,
        interview skills, guest speakers, and a variety of community outings. PEP students encourage to pursue enrichment experiences in a variety of ways,
        such as community/adult learning courses and/or Career and Technical Education (CTE) classes.

        <br><br>Prerequisite(s): The referral process must begin with the transition coordinator at the comprehensive high school. The PEP Program Coordinator
        then reviews all transition coordinator referrals, taking into account the students' age, attendance record, student conduct (school and community), year in
        school, and prior job training experience.
